Examples include \nCheckmarx and Veracode, which provide developers with comprehensive analysis and feedback. At Seezo.io, we streamline a crucial aspect of security: incremental threat modeling. These tools identify vulnerabilities and coding errors such as buffer overflows, \nSQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), hard-coded credentials, and insecure cryptographic usage. For instance, Semgrep is a popular tool that continuously monitors code quality and identifies security flaws. •Conduct vulnerability scans to identify and address security issues in external components. The current tooling in the AppSec world (SAST, \nDAST, Container scanning, etc.) In this section, we explore four critical \napplication security tools, including those for the architecture and design phase, as well as SAST, DAST, and \nSCA tools, highlighting their roles in enhancing security throughout the development process. Create security requirements as child tickets: All the above information is visible to your Security team \non the Seezo portal.

Check out Seezo! Seezo.io is a platform designed to enhance application security by providing automated security design \nreviews for every feature developed by a company. Seezo is highly recommended. Seezo uses a combination \nof Multi-modal RAG (scans images, tables, flowcharts, and text), prompt engineering ( to look for relevant \nsecurity controls), and decision trees (to reduce hallucination) to achieve these results. Seezo.io is a platform dedicated to offering automated security design reviews for software features. Seezo can help solve this. However, Seezo offers significant advantages:\nConsistent output: Seezo automatically asks the right questions, providing \nconsistent outputs regardless of the Security Engineer’s level of knowledge. Seezo is designed with enterprise needs in mind and supports multiple \ndeployment options to comply with your internal standards. Since Seezo helps in \nproviding security requirements, many of these vulnerabilities will not be introduced in code if correctly \nimplemented. With context-specific security insights, Seezo.io ensures that security considerations are \nintegrated from the start, helping you build a resilient application right from the design phase. We’re ready to integrate the tools you need so \nSeezo fits seamlessly into your workflow\nCustomisable to your \ncompany’s needs\nSeezo integrates with your coding \nstandards, understands company-specific \njargon, and tailors rules to match your risk \nprofile.
